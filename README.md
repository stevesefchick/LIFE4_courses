# LIFE4 TRIAL COURSES FOR STEPMANIA

Pre-reqs:
- Stepmania 
- Just about every version of DDR's songlist organized by folder. <a href="https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/simfiles.php">You can get simfiles here</a>!

Instructions:
- Download the contents of this repo to your Courses directory in Stepmania
- Edit the .crs files and confirm that the folders referenced have the same naming structure as your DDR song folders. I have mine set up in the folder structure "Dance Dance Revolution [version]" but if you're using something like "DDR [version]" you'll probably have to do some light editing. 
- When selecting your trial in Courses, choose the difficulty setting that reflects the level of the trial (it should always be Medium). Stepmania will auto generate additional course difficulties if the songs have easier or harder difficulty levels. Unless, of course, you want to!
